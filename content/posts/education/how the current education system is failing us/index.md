From a holocaust survivor.

My eyes saw gas chambers built by learned engineers. Chilldren poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained urses. Women and babies shot by high school graduates. So im suspicous of education.

Help your chilldren become human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters or skilled psychopaths.  reading, writing and arithemtic are there to make your human more efficient.
