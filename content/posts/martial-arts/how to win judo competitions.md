If you have a competition ahead and you have no idea how you should train, this guide is for you. These tips apply whether it's for a dojo fight or a competition. However, this is mostly intended for beginners who do not have much experience with Judo fights and have upcoming contests.

## 5 ways to win a fight

Before dreaming that you are getting the gold make sure you know the following ways that can make you victorious.	
1. **Ippon throw:** The most desirable way to win a fight. You throw your opponent and he falls on his back giving you instant victory.
2. **Pinning:** Pin your opponent to the ground for 25 seconds. (Opponents knee should not touch the ground)
3. **Points:** You throw your opponent but he doesn't fall properly. Keeping him on the ground will generate points. Of course, 25 seconds pinning will result in victory.
4. **Submission:** You choke/lock your opponent in such a way so that he is forced to tap out.
5. **Disqualification:** Opponent makes illegal moves or misbehaves resulting in disqualification.

## The areas to work on

**Strength** and **techniques** are the two key areas you need to work on. Remember that strength without technique is useless and technique without strength is futile.

## Strength training

If you look closely, a Judo throw has three crucial parts:
1. **The grip:** The person having the greater grip strength will control his opponent. Without control on your opponent, you won't get a chance to attempt a throw.
2. **The pull (kuzushi):** A pull must be strong and firm. If your pull is not good, you'll be thrown off balance and your imbalanced stance will be used against you.
3. **The lift:** Even with a good pull, your throw will not go well if you are thrown off balance. That's why you will need loads of muscle power in your legs.

So what to do?

For a strong **grip**, do climbing, hanging, or any sort of exercise that includes gripping. If possible buy yourself a gripper and grip it often.

For a strong **pull**, do as much pull ups and push ups you can. Try increasing the numbers each day. If you can do 10 push ups in one go today, make sure tomorrow you can do 11. And most importantly do lots and lots of uchi komi. It is better if you practice uchi komi with a heavier partner. While doing uchi komi maintain a steady rhythm.

For a strong **lift**, do squats. Do at least 100 squats every day and do them with speed. You will notice a huge improvement in your balance.

## Throwing techniques (Nage-waza)

Selecting the right technique is crucial. If you're taller than your opponent then you'll have a hard time bending down for doing throws. For a tall person, leg techniques are more suitable. Being tall, you should consider the following techniques:
1. Tai otoshi
2. Osotogari
3. Kouchi gari
4. Uchimata
5. Harai goshi
6. Ouchi gari
7. Deashi barai

If you are shorter than your opponent then leg techniques won't be very useful as it will be difficult to reach for your opponent's legs. For a shorter person, bending down is easier. Being shorter you should consider the following techniques:
1. Ippon seoi nage
2. Morote seoi nage
3. Kata guruma
4. Sode tsurikomi goshi 
5. Ogoshi
6. Morote gari
7. Drop seoi nage (absolute killer!!!) [both ippon and morote will do]

It is not necessary to know all the techniques mentioned above. The number of techniques you know does not matter. What matters is if you know how to apply a technique correctly. Being able to do 1 technique well is better than being able to do 3 techniques that are not so well.

## Grappling techniques (Katame-waza)

It is highly likely that a Judo fight will go onto the ground especially if the players are new. Rookie players do incomplete techniques and are thrown off balance during mid-throw positions. So, knowing ground techniques is essential.

But the problem is ground techniques are very complicated and requires more time to learn. You can go quite fat with brute strength. Just make sure you know how to do **Hon kesa gatame** and **Yoko shiho gatame** and how to get out of them.

## Pro tips
1. Before participating in a competition, start practicing at least 1 month before. If you are late then start right now!
2. Try to play in the weight category closest to your weight. Suppose you are 67 kg and the closest weight category is under 65. Then reduce 2 kgs and then participate. Again, suppose you are 68 kg and the closest weight category is under 71. Increase 2 kgs and then participate. Having the maximum weight in your weight category will give you a huge advantage.
3. Don't try to learn all the techniques mentioned above. Just pick 2 or 3 at max that you are more familiar with.
4. **Master 1 technique.** Pick the technique you are best at and do it 1000 times. The intent of doing one technique on the mat is better than the intent of doing many techniques. Even professional Judo players follow this strategy. They do it with 3 or 4 techniques though (out of the about 67 throws). There are competitions where players win gold by getting Ippons with only one technique.
5. During a fight, if you are in a deadlock (neither you nor your opponent is falling), try to act that you are attempting throws. This will give judges a good impression and may earn you points. This can be also applied in situations where your opponent is highly experienced and you cannot throw him and neither can he throw you. Fake that you're trying and you might end up winning based on the judge's decision.
